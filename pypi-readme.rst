Golden Hinges
=============

Golden Hinges (full documentation `here <https://edinburgh-genome-foundry.github.io/GoldenHinges/>`_) is a Python library to find sets of overhangs (also called junctions, or protrusions) for multipart DNA assembly such as Golden Gate assembly.

Given a set of constraints (GC content bounds, differences between overhangs,
mandatory and forbidden overhangs) Golden Hinges enables to find:

- Maximal sets of valid and inter-compatible overhangs.
- Sequence decompositions (i.e. position of cuts) which produce valid and
  inter-compatible overhangs, for type-2S DNA assembly.
- Sequence mutations (subject to constraints) which enable the sequence
  decomposition, in extreme cases where the original sequence does not allow
  for such decomposition.
